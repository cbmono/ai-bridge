# unverified-read-is-unknown.test.sh — the UNKNOWN rule survives in `seed/CONVENTIONS.md`
# WITH its four measured examples, and stays referenced from the three places that make
# the claims: the launcher, the tick, and the rule it generalises.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Four of the twelve symptoms of 2026-09-08 (`alteos`) were one defect —
# the read returned something and the something was treated as the answer — and every one
# of them was made in the main session. The fix is prose, and prose with no reader rots:
# the previous fix for this class shipped 2026-08-23 and was gone within weeks (control
# panel: knowledge/findings/a-rule-with-no-reader-is-not-a-rule.md). Modelled on
# tests/read-the-error-text-first.test.sh, which pins its sibling rule the same way.
#
# THE TWO FAILURE MODES IT PINS AGAINST, because a thinning edit arrives as one of these:
#
#   THE EXAMPLES ARE CUT AS DECORATION. The rule reads complete without them — which is
#   the whole problem, since its abstract form is already believed by everyone who then
#   breaks it. MUTATION B deletes exactly the table and requires all eight halves to flip.
#
#   THE SEED ARGUMENT IS CUT AS HISTORY. Why this is seed prose and not one bundle's rule
#   is the independent reinvention, and a later tidy-up reads that as backstory.
#   MUTATION C deletes it with the rule left standing.
#
# Matching is done on a NEWLINE-SQUEEZED copy of each document, so a phrase that reflows
# across a line break still matches and a re-wrap does not turn this red for no change.
#
# ok() follows this directory's convention: it compares actual to expected.
