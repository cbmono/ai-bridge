#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# loop-cadence.test.sh — the tick cadence runs on the first-party `/loop`, and a firing
# that lands mid-tick is a clean skip rather than a fault.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `/loop [interval] <prompt>` and `/schedule` (remote routines) both ship
# with Claude Code, and until now ai-bridge documented neither: the cadence was the owner
# re-running `/ai-bridge:dispatch` by hand, or a session babysitting it. Naming `/loop` in
# a document is cheap and unenforced — the control panel's
# knowledge/findings/a-rule-with-no-reader-is-not-a-rule.md counts six rules in one month
# that were prose and therefore were not rules — so the half that is BEHAVIOUR is driven
# for real here against a lock file on disk, and the half that is a CONTRACT is pinned by
# phrase.
#
# THE PROPERTY, STATED SO A REVIEWER CAN REFUSE THE CHANGE ON IT. A clock knows nothing
# about tick length, so most firings of a 10m loop land while an earlier tick is still
# running. For that caller a held lock is the ORDINARY outcome, and it must read as one:
# ONE line, on STDOUT, naming when the running tick started. Not the launcher's three-to-
# six-line HELD block on stderr, which is written for a human who typed a command and
# expected a dispatch, and which repeated six times an hour teaches an operator to stop
# reading the loop's output.
#
# AND THE HALF THAT IS EASY TO GET BACKWARDS: THE EXIT CODE DOES NOT MOVE. A held lock is
# still exit 1 under `--as loop`. `0 is the only clearance to dispatch` is the invariant
# every caller of tick-lock.sh rests on, and a mode where 0 sometimes meant "do not
# dispatch" would leave the caller telling the two apart by PARSING WHAT WAS PRINTED — the
# failure recorded in the control panel's
# a-caller-cannot-act-on-a-distinction-its-classifier-does-not-draw. So section 1 asserts
# BOTH directions: the report is one quiet line, AND the code is still 1. A future edit
# that "finishes the job" by returning 0 turns this red.
#
# SECTION 3 IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT AN OPINION. The reason a scheduled cloud routine cannot
# run this loop is that `/schedule` creates REMOTE agents, which get a fresh clone of a
# GitHub repository — and a bundle's operating inputs are gitignored, so a fresh clone has
# none of them. That is checkable against the seed `.gitignore` every stamped bundle
# carries, with `git check-ignore` as the oracle, so the doc's "7 of 7" is re-measured on
# every run rather than trusted. The `.tick-lock` row is the load-bearing one: the lock is
# per clone, so a routine in its own clone is a SECOND orchestrator by a route the lock
# cannot see.
#
# ok() follows this directory's convention: it compares actual to expected.
