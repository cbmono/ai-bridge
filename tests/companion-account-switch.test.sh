# companion-account-switch.test.sh — the `ai-bridge-accounts` companion: which account a
# bundle is on, the three renderings that answer says, the launcher's refusals, and the
# one boundary that is not a preference — NO CREDENTIAL EVER REACHES A BUNDLE REPO.
#
# WHY A FIXTURE REGISTRY AND A FIXTURE HOME. The real registry says whatever this machine
# happens to have installed, and the real ~/.claude holds the developer's live credential.
# Every case below points CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR and HOME at trees this file wrote, so each
# answer is a property of the code and no assertion can touch a real secret.
#
# NON-VACUOUS BY CONSTRUCTION: the match, mismatch and no-account cases run against ONE
# fixture and differ only in the field under test, so a resolver answering the same thing
# to everything fails here instead of passing three cases in four.
