# approach-critique-trigger.test.sh — the PM's `plan-architect` approach critique is
# MANDATORY ON ITS TRIGGER and ADVISORY IN WHAT IT MAY DECIDE, and neither half is
# allowed to drift into the other.
#
# WHY THIS IS A TEST AND NOT A PARAGRAPH SOMEBODY WROTE. The clause shipped as
# "you MAY dispatch … don't run it on every draft (cost)". Discretionary, non-binding
# and cost-suppressed together mean it ran on nothing, while `acceptance_criteria` —
# the artifact that becomes the PR body's checklist and whose unverified rows block
# clearance — went to the merge gate with no adversarial read at all. Measured
# 2026-08-31: an under-specified criterion took THREE rounds of external review to
# converge on what one such read would have caught before any code existed.
#
# Making it mandatory is one word. The three things that make it survive being one word
# are what is asserted here:
#
#   1. THE TRIGGER DID NOT MOVE, AND NEITHER DID THE AUTHORITY. What changed is WHEN the
#      critique runs; what it may DECIDE is untouched. So the trigger's own words are
#      pinned, and so is every "this is not a gate" clause — findings to `advisor_notes`
#      and nowhere else, no status, no `draft → ready`, `kind: research` still excluded.
#      A future edit that quietly hands the critique a veto fails here.
#   2. IT IS IDEMPOTENT, AND THE MARKER IS NAMED. Mandatory-on-trigger with no recorded
#      marker turns every tick into a fresh APEX-tier session on the same draft — the
#      most expensive failure this change could introduce. The instruction has to name
#      the receipt a tick reads before dispatching, and it does: an `advisor_notes`
#      entry, or an `advisor:` line in `answered_questions` for a critique that raised
#      none.
#   3. A MISSING OPTIONAL AGENT IS STILL NOT A FAILURE. Mandatory-on-trigger must not
#      become mandatory-to-exist: absent `~/.claude/agents/plan-architect.md` the PM
#      skips SILENTLY. And `plan-architect` stays OUT of `roles` while staying in
#      `roleTiers` at `apex` (SCHEMA.md's worked example of an agent no task is ever
#      assigned to), with the dispatch resolving its model through
#      `scripts/resolve-model.sh` rather than a hard-coded alias.
#
# TWO CLAIMS ARE DRIVEN, NOT READ. "`advisor_notes` is not a gate" is a claim about
# machinery, so the machinery is run: `validate-bundle.sh` against a bundle whose task
# carries advisor notes (it must pass and say nothing about them), and
# `write-snapshot.sh` over the same task (advisor notes must produce NO awaiting verb,
# while an open question on a sibling task still produces one — the control that keeps
# the first assertion non-vacuous).
#
# EVERY MUTATION IS GUARDED. A mutation whose anchor has moved prints SKIP and is never
# counted as caught: a check that silently stopped checking is worse than no check.
#
# ok() follows this directory's convention: it compares actual to expected.
