# seed-promoted-rules.test.sh — the three rules four stamped bundles had each written by
# hand now ship in the seed, and each one stays in the file that OWNS it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A 2026-09-08 sweep of four bundles found the same rules hand-written in
# individual CLAUDE.md files, one of them (`.scratch/`) surviving in no live doc at all.
# Promotion is only half the fix: a rule in the seed with nothing reading it is deleted by
# the next person tightening the file, and nobody learns it went. So each rule is asserted
# WITH ITS SECTION — a rule that survives as a sentence somewhere else in the file has
# stopped being where its reader looks.
#
# Rule 3 of the original four (`maxOpenPrs`) was NOT promoted and must not appear: the key
# was never the owner's policy, it traces to one session's self-imposed dispatch throttle,
# and it ships no reader. Section 4 keeps it out.
#
# Rule 4 has a second half that is not prose — `prune-worktrees.sh` has to RECOGNISE the
# directory the rule names, or a bundle that obeys the rule gets worktrees held forever by
# their own scratch dir. That half is exercised, not grepped.
#
# The path itself moved on 2026-09-09 (`.scratch/` -> `tmp/`): the old one is TRACKED in this
# repo. `scratch-path-is-ignored.test.sh` owns that invariant; this file pins the wording.
#
# Matching is done on a NEWLINE-SQUEEZED copy of each document, so a phrase that reflows
# across a line break still matches and a re-wrap does not turn this red for no change.
#
# ok() follows this directory's convention: it compares actual to expected.
