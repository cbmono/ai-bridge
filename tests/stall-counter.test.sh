#
# stall-counter.test.sh — the same blocker twice escalates to the human, and a slow PR
# does not.
#
# WHAT IS BEING PINNED, AND WHY IT NEEDED A HARNESS RATHER THAN A PARAGRAPH. "After N
# rounds on the same blocker, stop dispatching and ask the human" is a rule with two
# failure directions that look identical from a tick's own report: escalating a PR that is
# merely SLOW (a review round-trip is minutes, and a task waiting on one has moved), and
# NOT escalating a task that has hit the same wall three times (which reads as an ordinary
# in-flight task and costs a full agent per tick). Prose cannot separate those; a fixture
# that fails twice on the same check and a fixture whose PR keeps moving can.
#
# THE MUTANT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR is the one the implementation got wrong first. The
# human-edit reset — a stale count dropped when the human puts a task back in the queue —
# is one line, and written as "at the cap and not `blocked`" it also matches the window
# BETWEEN `record` and `escalate`, where the task is `in-progress` and at the cap with
# nothing wrong. That version zeroes the count between the two calls, `escalate` then
# refuses, and the escalation never happens — the single path the whole feature exists for,
# defeated by a check that looks like a safety net. So the window is asserted directly
# ("== the record→escalate window is not a human edit ==") rather than left to be implied
# by the happy path, which passes under both spellings.
#
# NON-VACUOUS BY CONSTRUCTION elsewhere too: every reset is asserted against the SAME
# fixture and the same call that escalates without it, so a reset that stopped working
# would flip a verdict rather than merely printing a different number.
#
# `assert()` uses exit-code semantics: 0 is a PASS, matching the other harnesses.
