# explorer-tier.test.sh — the `explorer` tier resolves like any other role, and its
# ABSENCE is the case that matters: broad reads go to an Explore subagent
# (seed/CONVENTIONS.md), so a caller that resolves nothing and is not told would
# dispatch it on whatever the session happens to be. Pins the whole config path
# offline — roleTiers.explorer -> tier -> models[tier] -> alias — plus the
# no-entry fallback (`light`) and the reason resolve-model.sh prints for it.
#
# Reasoning: /projects/ai-bridge-next/tasks/task-023-*.md.
# ok() compares actual to expected, as everywhere else in this directory.
