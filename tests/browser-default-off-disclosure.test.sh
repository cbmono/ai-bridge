# browser-default-off-disclosure.test.sh — `browser:` stays OFF by default, the same fact
# is written in three files, the DISCLOSURE of what granting it means ships, and the write
# gate is not part of the change.
#
# WHY THREE FILES. The default is stated in `seed/SCHEMA.md` (the field), in
# `skills/new-project/SKILL.md` (the question a human answers) and in
# `seed/CONVENTIONS.md` (the only browser text a dispatched role agent reads at run time).
# One fact written three times is how a default drifts: change two and the third still
# governs somebody's behaviour.
#
# WHY THE WRITE GATE IS PINNED WHOLE RATHER THAN GREPPED. A grep for the gate's opening
# and closing strings still passes when a loosening sentence is inserted BETWEEN them — so
# the assertion below is on the region, and the CONTROL MUTANT section is exactly that
# insertion, following tests/blocked-vs-own-tools.test.sh:284-290. The mutant is shown to
# defeat the two-grep check and to be caught by the pinned region.

4. **Writes follow the project's `autonomy`, like every other gate.** **Ask first before
   any browser write** — that is the default and the only behaviour unless the project's
   `autonomy` delegates writes (see `AUTONOMY.md`; absent that file, always ask).
   Read-only navigation and screenshots never need permission.
   Two limits are *not* autonomy-specific and hold in **every** mode: an agent
   **doesn't redefine scope**, so a write nobody asked for is never licensed (the same
   rule that stops it inventing code changes); and irreversible actions well outside the
   task — a payment, deleting an account, mailing a customer — are worth one confirmation
   on cost grounds, not permission grounds. When in genuine doubt about blast radius, say
   what you're about to do and continue unless told otherwise.
GATE

cat > "$TMP/gate-skill.expected" <<'GATE'
   If **browser = claude-for-chrome** and the chosen mode **delegates browser writes**,
   don't block it — that combination is supported and deliberate. State once what it means
   so the choice is informed: agents may **write** in the human's logged-in browser
   (submit forms, change settings) without asking, including from background `/ai-bridge:dispatch`
   dispatches, and the extension's **per-site permissions** are then the effective
   boundary. Record that in `# Context` and continue. Otherwise browser writes ask first
   (see `SCHEMA.md` → "Browser access").
