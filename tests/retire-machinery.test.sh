# retire-machinery.test.sh — `/ai-bridge:init` removes a machinery symlink into a template
# checkout, and nothing else.
#
# WHY. Removing a capability from `symlink/` (the /todo feature was the first) left every
# already-stamped bundle with a symlink into a path that no longer existed. That is worse
# than an absent file: a dangling command still registers, and a SessionStart hook whose
# script has vanished exits 127 on every launch.
#
# WHAT THE SWEEP BECAME (ai-bridge-v2/task-013). Machinery ships in the PLUGIN now, so
# there is nothing left to retire ONE file at a time: the whole `symlink/` design is what
# is retired, and the sweep removes EVERY machinery link a bundle carries — dangling or
# live. A live one is the quieter half of the same defect, because it resolves into a
# clone `claude plugin update` never touches. The old per-file cases are therefore one
# case now, and the historical retirements are asserted as a set against it.
#
# The negative properties are the point, and they are what this file mostly asserts:
#   · a real file is never removed, however dead it looks;
#   · a symlink pointing somewhere OTHER than a template checkout is never removed, even
#     when it dangles — it is not ours to judge;
#   · a bundle path containing glob metacharacters is handled (SC2295);
#   · seed content is never removed. A `todos.md` surviving a retired feature is the
#     human's own writing — that half is unchanged and is the last section of this file.
#
# assert(): 0 is a PASS, matching the other harnesses here.
