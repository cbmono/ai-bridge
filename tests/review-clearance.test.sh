# review-clearance.test.sh — exercises precondition 2 of the delegated merge gate,
# symlink/scripts/review-clearance.sh.
#
# THE THREE SHAPES, and only one of them clears:
#
#   1. a real review        → exit 0    (tests/fixtures/reviewer/clean-review.pr29.md)
#   2. a REFUSAL behind a green check → exit 1
#                              (tests/fixtures/reviewer/rate-limit-refusal.pr30.md)
#   3. no reviewer signal at all      → exit 3
#
# Shapes 1 and 2 are RECORDED, verbatim, from the two pull requests where this went
# wrong: #29 was reviewed, #30 and #31 were refused behind an identically green check
# and merged unreviewed, one of them shipping a shell script at mode 100644. Handwritten
# samples would prove nothing here — the whole difficulty is that the two real bodies
# look alike, and only a real one can show how alike.
#
# THE FALSE POSITIVE THIS FILE EXISTS TO PIN. The refusal comment carries the same
# "between <base> and <head>" range a real review carries, and on #30 that head WAS the
# PR head. So the obvious detector — "does an artifact name the current head" — returns
# TRUE for the refusal. `the trap` section below asserts that property of the fixture
# first (so the test fails if the evidence ever changes) and then asserts the script
# refuses anyway. Get the order of the two classifications wrong and this file goes red.
#
# `gh` and `jq` are replaced by stubs on PATH, so the whole matrix runs offline; the jq
# stub delegates to the real one unless a fixture asks it to break.
