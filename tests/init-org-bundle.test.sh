# init-org-bundle.test.sh — `plugin/scripts/init-bundle.sh --org <org> [--name <repo>]`,
# the step that makes a bundle the ORGANISATION'S repo instead of a folder somebody
# pushes wherever they like. Both paths, offline, against bare fixture remotes.
#
# THE FOUR SHAPES, and only two of them stamp anything:
#
#   1. absent + access established   -> create <org>/<name> private, seed, push
#   2. absent + create REFUSED       -> create <me>/<name>, seed, push, print the transfer
#   3. present and a bundle          -> clone; tracked config kept, local file written
#   4. absent + access UNESTABLISHED -> refuse. A 404 from `gh repo view` answers the same
#      for "does not exist" and for "private, and you cannot see it", so shape 4 is the one
#      that matters: taking it for shape 1 seeds a fresh bundle over the org's real one,
#      for the SECOND person, on their first command. The assertions therefore check that
#      nothing was created (the stub logs every call) as well as the exit code.
#
#   …and shape 3's sibling: a repo that EXISTS and is not a bundle is refused BY NAME
#   rather than stamped, because `<org>-okf` may already be somebody's unrelated repo.
#
# `gh` is a stub on PATH and every remote is a local bare repo, so the whole matrix runs
# with no network. ok() compares actual to expected, in that argument order.
