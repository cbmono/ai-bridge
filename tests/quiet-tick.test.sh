# quiet-tick.test.sh — a tick that changed nothing prints ONE line and touches nothing.
#
# THE FIXTURE IS A BUNDLE WITH NO DISPATCHABLE WORK: every task `draft` or `done`, an
# `AWAITING.md` already on disk, a recorded fingerprint. Against it this file walks the
# idle path of `project-manager.md` step 0.9 in the order the step gives it — probe,
# ledger append, commit, `tick-delta.sh record` — and asserts what the human is left
# with: one line naming the next check, and an `AWAITING.md` whose bytes AND mtime never
# moved. mtime is asserted separately from content because a rewrite of identical text
# still churns the `Last refreshed:` line the next render reads.
#
# BOTH DIRECTIONS, because "prints one line" alone passes a probe that is silent about
# real work: the changing fixture must produce the multi-line report naming what moved,
# and must NOT produce the quiet line. And the loop must STAY quiet — three consecutive
# idle ticks are three one-line reports, which is the measured symptom this exists for
# ("Repeat notification, no new information").
#
# The model is the other half of the actor here, so the prose contract it reads is
# pinned too — a script that stays silent cannot stop a tick that reports anyway.
# `gh` is never called: the fixture holds no `in-review` task, so nothing is fetched.
