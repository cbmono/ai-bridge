# pr-verdict-clearance.test.sh — the checker re-derives the criteria table, and the
# comparison of the two tables is what routes.
#
# WHAT IS PINNED. The three cases ai-bridge-next/task-013 names — identical tables pass,
# one disagreement routes and quotes BOTH rows, a checker row with no command is refused
# — plus the identity rule and the two ways the tables cannot be aligned at all.
#
# NON-VACUOUS BY CONSTRUCTION. Every refusal case is run against a fixture that differs
# from a clearing one in ONE cell, and the clearing fixture is asserted in the same block,
# so a script that stopped reading the checker's column would flip a verdict rather than
# print a different shape. Two mutants drive the two assertions a wrong answer would hide:
# one that ignores the checker's FAIL, one that skips the evidence check.
#
# THE HOST IS STUBBED. `gh` answers from $FIX so the PR-mode read is exercised without a
# network, and the stub records what it was asked for.
