# do-not-repeat.test.sh — a failed round's dead end reaches the NEXT dispatch's brief,
# verbatim.
#
# WHAT IS PINNED, AND WHY IT IS THE BRIEF TEXT. The feature is worth nothing unless the
# line an agent wrote at the end of round 1 is in front of the agent dispatched for round
# 2, so the measurement is the generated BRIEF, on a fixture: append one entry, then assert
# the second dispatch's brief carries the heading and that entry character for character.
# Deliberately NOT a test of what a model does with the brief — that is unmeasurable here,
# and a harness that asserted it would be asserting nothing.
#
# NON-VACUOUS BY CONSTRUCTION. The same task's brief is captured BEFORE the append (empty,
# and not carrying the line) and after, so a `brief` that stopped reading the field would
# flip a verdict rather than print a different shape.
#
# THE HEADING IS PINNED IN TWO PLACES ON PURPOSE — here as a literal, and against
# `project-manager.md`, which tells the PM to paste the block unchanged. A rename that
# lands in the script alone leaves the PM instructing agents to look for a heading nothing
# emits (knowledge/findings/renaming-a-string-a-gate-greps-for-needs-a-second-narrower-
# table.md is the same class).
#
# `assert()` uses exit-code semantics: 0 is a PASS, matching the other harnesses.
