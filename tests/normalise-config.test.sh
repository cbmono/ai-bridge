#
# normalise-config.test.sh — `normalise-config.sh` reports the three finding kinds, moves
# and adds without ever changing a value, and `/ai-bridge:init` runs it on every stamp.
#
# WHY. Measured 2026-09-07 across the owner's three bundles: absolute paths in the TRACKED
# `instance.config.json`, `defaultOwner` duplicated into a per-machine file, every key
# added since 1.x missing, and three different key orders. Nothing was an error the
# validator caught, and a plugin update cannot reach a bundle's data — so the stamp is
# where the two files get put right.
#
# WHAT IS PINNED, one group each:
#
#   1. MISPLACED — a per-machine key in the tracked file, a tracked-only key in the local
#      one — and the LOCAL-WINS rule: an existing destination value is never overwritten,
#      the source copy is dropped, and a destination `null` is ABSENCE and gets filled
#      (SCHEMA.md → "Per-machine config overrides").
#   2. MISSING and the `$doc` rule: a seed key absent from the tracked file is added with
#      the seed default; a `$`-prefixed seed comment is NEVER added, and a bundle's own
#      `$` key is kept and travels with the key it annotates.
#   3. ORDER, and the ROUND TRIP: a normalised pair reports nothing on a second run, which
#      is the property that makes this safe to run on every stamp.
#   4. NO VALUE EVER CHANGES — asserted over every key of a deliberately mangled pair,
#      the one rule whose violation would be silent and unrecoverable.
#   5. `/ai-bridge:init` — silent about config on a clean pair, reports on a dirty one,
#      applies with `--normalise-config` and at an interactive yes, and leaves the tracked
#      file STAGED rather than committed.
#   6. The stamp leaves NO per-machine path in the tracked file and invents none in the
#      local one — criterion 7, and the defect the whole task was opened for.
#
# THE FIXTURE TEMPLATE IS A PLAIN DIRECTORY COPY of `git ls-files`, never this checkout,
# for the reason local-tier-seed.test.sh states: an uncommitted edit under review is what
# runs, and no fixture ever writes into the repo.
#
# ok() compares actual to expected, in that argument order — this directory's convention.
