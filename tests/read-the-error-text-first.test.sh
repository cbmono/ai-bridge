# read-the-error-text-first.test.sh — the two clauses of the cheapest rule on the
# `launcher-verification-contract` list survive in BOTH files that carry them, and each
# one keeps THE COST that is the only reason anybody follows it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Retrospective of 2026-09-08 (`alteos`): the failing check's own error
# text already named both the RBAC problem and the wrong ArgoCD project. Both were guessed
# instead, in that order, wrongly, and each guess was probed with a full CI cycle — every
# stage through to testing — which is the direct cause of the "hours, and many builds" the
# owner reported. The fix is pure prose, and prose with no reader rots: see the control
# panel's knowledge/findings/a-rule-with-no-reader-is-not-a-rule.md, and the 2026-08-23
# fix for this same class that had no test and was gone within weeks. Modelled on
# tests/local-vs-ci-testing.test.sh, which pins a CONVENTIONS rule the same way.
#
# THE TWO FAILURE MODES IT PINS AGAINST, because "shorten it" arrives as one of these:
#
#   THE COST IS CUT AS PADDING. The instruction alone — "read the log", "test locally" —
#   is already believed by everyone who skipped it, so a clause reduced to its instruction
#   is a clause that changes nothing while looking present. MUTATIONS B and E delete
#   exactly the cost sentences and require every cost assertion to flip.
#
#   CLAUSE 1 IS DEMOTED OUT OF FIRST PLACE in failure-analyst.md. A diagnostician that has
#   reached a hypothesis before it opens the log has nothing left for the evidence to do,
#   so ORDER is the rule and position is asserted POSITIONALLY — the first `1. ` item of
#   the `## Diagnosis` section, not merely somewhere in the file. MUTATION D keeps the
#   clause and moves it to the end; the ordering assertion must notice.
#
# Matching is done on a NEWLINE-SQUEEZED copy of each document, so a phrase that reflows
# across a line break still matches and a re-wrap does not turn this red for no change.
#
# ok() follows this directory's convention: it compares actual to expected.
