# pr-comment-clearance.sh — assert that a PULL-REQUEST COMMENT carries the required SHAPE
# of a reply to review findings: a lead, one ENTRY per finding with an explicit verdict on
# it, and the closing evidence — each of those elements inside one measured ceiling.
#
#   Usage: scripts/pr-comment-clearance.sh --comment <id> [--repo <owner>/<name>]
#          scripts/pr-comment-clearance.sh --review-comment <id> [--repo <owner>/<name>]
#          scripts/pr-comment-clearance.sh --comment-file <path>  (decide before posting)
#          scripts/pr-comment-clearance.sh --self-test            (prove this script RUNS)
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY THE SIBLING DID NOT COVER IT. `pr-body-clearance.sh` reads a
# pull request's BODY. It does not look at comments at all. So the house style for a reply
# — `CONVENTIONS.md`, "The reply is a list, not a letter" and "A GitHub comment is about
# 280 characters" — was governed by prose alone on the one surface nothing read, and on
# 2026-08-31 a reply whose whole content was *"both findings are valid, neither is fixed in
# this PR, and here is why"* ran to **2,986 characters over 20 lines**: roughly 250
# characters of decision wrapped in twelve times its own weight. That is
# [[a-rule-with-no-reader-is-not-a-rule]] inside the machinery built to end that pattern.
# This file is the reader for the comment.
#
# IT IS STRUCTURAL, AND NO EXIT CODE HERE IS DERIVED FROM A TOTAL CHARACTER COUNT.
# A total cap is the obvious implementation and the wrong one, for the reason the sibling
# states in its own error text: it refuses the legitimately detailed reply and clears the
# short self-defending one. A reply that addresses eleven findings honestly needs eleven
# times the words of one that addresses one. So the budget is derived from the reply's own
# structure — a reply to review findings addresses N findings, so it has N entries — and
# the ceiling below is applied PER ELEMENT. Total budget therefore grows with N, and a
# well-structured reply of any length clears: `tests/pr-comment-clearance.test.sh` drives
# a reply LONGER than the measured incident and asserts it clears. The reply's own
# character count is printed once as information and never read again: NO THRESHOLD, NO
# CONSTANT AND NO COMPARISON ON IT EXISTS ANYWHERE BELOW, and the harness asserts that
# statically as well as behaviourally.
#
# THE ELEMENTS, AND HOW EACH IS FOUND.
#
#   1. THE ENTRIES — one per finding. Found structurally, not by text: a list item
#      (`- `, `* `, `+ `, `1. `, `1) `), an ATX heading, or a TABLE DATA ROW. All three are
#      in the real corpus below, and the table form is there because our best-shaped
#      measured reply used `| finding | verdict | fix |` — a reader that only knew about
#      bullets would have refused the one reply that got it right. A line indented two
#      spaces or more is a CONTINUATION of the entry above it, never a new entry: reading
#      a nested bullet as its own entry would divide one element's bytes among several and
#      make the ceiling more lenient, which is the wrong direction for a mistake.
#
#      KNOWN LIMIT, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED: a SECTION heading above the list (`###
#      Round 1 replies`) is read as an entry, and refused at exit 1 for carrying no
#      verdict, naming itself in the message. The failure direction is a refusal and a
#      glance, the fix is deleting one line, and the house style already puts what round
#      it is in the LEAD. Recognising a heading is what catches the measured comment,
#      whose findings were `###` headings, so this is the cost of that and not an
#      oversight.
#
#   2. THE VERDICT ON EACH ENTRY — the identifying property, and the analogue of the
#      `✓`/`✗` column the sibling requires of a criteria table. It is what tells a reply to
#      review findings from any other list, and it is the one thing the reviewer on the
#      other end actually needs: *valid / fixed / declined / already deferred*. An entry
#      with no verdict is refused at exit 1, by index. Table 2 below is the vocabulary,
#      matched case-insensitively; it is deliberately wider than the three words
#      `CONVENTIONS.md` uses, because a gate that refuses `confirmed` or `not taking` would
#      be refusing correct work, and a gate that refuses correct work gets switched off.
#
#   3. THE LEAD AND THE CLOSING EVIDENCE. Everything before the first entry is the LEAD;
#      the last blank-line-separated block after the last entry is the TAIL (the evidence
#      line the house style asks for). Both are bounded exactly as an entry is — because
#      in the measured corpus the bloat sat in the LEAD as often as in an entry (two real
#      replies carried leads of 1,135 and 1,759 bytes above a correctly-shaped list), and a
#      ceiling that watched only the entries would have cleared both.
#
#   4. A REPLY WITH NO ENTRIES IS ONE ELEMENT. `@coderabbitai review` (20 bytes) and
#      "Round 2 clean, nothing further" are legitimate replies, and refusing them for
#      having no findings to address would be nonsense. So a reply with no entry marker is
#      measured as a single element against the same ceiling — which is also what catches
#      the other real defect in the corpus: two replies of 897 and 1,078 bytes, and one of
#      3,796, that were one wall of prose where a per-finding list belonged. The refusal
#      says to give each finding its own entry.
#
# THE CEILING IS 618 BYTES PER ELEMENT, AND HERE IS THE CORPUS IT CAME FROM.
# Measured 2026-08-31, bytes under `LC_ALL=C`, over the fence-stripped rendering: every
# comment written by this repo's own agents on `cbmono/ai-bridge` pull requests 60-84 (13
# PR-thread comments + 3 inline review comments = 16 replies, 36 entries), plus the
# `alteos-gmbh/monorepo#3260` comment that motivated the task.
#

#     lead             0, 0, 59, 74, 96, 99, 157, 167, 278,     12

#     entry            60 .. 530 (30 of them), then 706, 779,   36
#                      849, 867, 959, 1841, 2318
#     tail             27, 45, 56, 84, 107, 161, 168, 174,      12

#     single element   20, 20, 20, 897, 1078                     5
#
# 618 IS THE MIDPOINT OF THE EMPTY BAND 531-705, and both sides of that band are named:
#
#   * BELOW IT, the largest element measured anywhere in the corpus is 530, and the two
#     replies whose shape is exactly what `CONVENTIONS.md` asks for — one entry per
#     finding, a verdict, the fix or the reason, nothing else — top out at 503 and 496.
#     Those two are 2,172 and 1,764 bytes in TOTAL, both far past "roughly a tweet", and
#     both clear here. That is the anti-total-cap property demonstrated on real data
#     rather than asserted.
#   * ABOVE IT, 706 is the smallest element the task's own design brief calls bloat: an
#     entry that argues its own case (*"this PR in reverse, on the path nobody looks
#     at"*), and above that 1,841 and 2,318 — the self-defending paragraphs.
#
# So the ceiling sits 88 bytes clear of the largest honest element and 88 short of the
# smallest offending one, which is symmetric by measurement and not by rounding.
#
# WHAT IT FAILS, COUNTED. The ceiling refuses 13 of the 65 elements and so 11 OF THE 17
# REPLIES (10 of the 16 real ai-bridge ones, plus the motivating comment). The VERDICT
# requirement refuses one further reply — `r-3890408025`, three short entries whose third
# reads *"Not the same defect as the red harness"*, which is a verdict this vocabulary does
# not know. So 12 of 17 are refused and 5 clear. That is a high rate and it is the honest
# one: this is a PRE-RULE corpus, written while the 280-character style had no reader at
# all, and 618 bytes per ELEMENT is already more than twice that whole-comment target. The
# one arguable false refusal costs its author one word. `tests/pr-comment-clearance.test.sh`
# pins the boundary values as FIXTURES (530 and 503 clear, 706 and 1841 refuse), so moving
# the number means re-measuring rather than editing a constant.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED. There is deliberately NO FLOOR. The
# sibling has one because an evidence cell reading `ok` is a claim with no evidence; here
# the equivalent entry, `- Finding 3 — fixed: a1b2c3d.`, is 30 bytes and complete, so a
# floor derived from anything in the corpus would refuse correct replies. This reader
# therefore requires the VERDICT and bounds the CEILING, and it does not judge whether the
# reason behind a verdict is adequate — that is a human's read, and narrowing the promise
# beats extending a text scan until it is unfalsifiable
# ([[narrow-the-promise-instead-of-extending-a-text-scan-forever]]). Nor does it decide
# whether a comment IS a reply to review findings: it answers "does this carry the shape a
# reply must have", and the caller invokes it on a reply.
#
# THE CARVE-OUTS FAIL OPEN, AND THEY SAY SO OUT LOUD. `CONVENTIONS.md` has always exempted
# three things from every brevity rule — an ERROR REPORT, a SECURITY FINDING, and a
# DESTRUCTIVE-ACTION CONFIRMATION — because the failure mode of a terseness gate is
# trimming the one thing the reader needed to act safely. Table 3 is that exemption, and it
# is the only match in this file whose false positive WEAKENS the gate. Three things keep
# it honest: it must LEAD a line's own content (a mid-sentence mention of "security" does
# not claim it), the clearance message quotes the line that claimed it, so an abuse is
# visible in the log rather than silent, and the vocabulary is small and written down here
# and in `CONVENTIONS.md` rather than inferred. AND IT EXEMPTS THE CEILING ONLY: it is read
# AFTER the verdict check, so a reply shaped as a list of findings still owes a verdict on
# each of them whatever it is reporting — which is what the rule in `CONVENTIONS.md` says,
# and the first cut of this file exempted both.
#
# GENERIC TEMPLATE FILE — symlinked from the `ai-bridge` template; do not edit per
# instance. It takes no org, repo or vendor identity: those come from the arguments.
#
# Exit codes — 0 is the ONLY clearance; every other code is a refusal:
#
#   0  the reply carries the shape, every element is inside the ceiling, at whatever total
#      length — or a carve-out is claimed, in which case the reason is printed
#   1  the reply is readable and the SHAPE is missing: it is empty, or an entry carries no
#      verdict. stderr names every entry it means, by index
#   2  usage error, or the environment cannot answer (no `gh`/`jq`, an unreadable comment,
#      an unreadable file, a pattern table that will not compile) — UNKNOWN, and unknown is
#      never clearance. A COMMENT THAT CANNOT BE FETCHED OR READ IS THIS CODE, NEVER 0:
#      reading a transient 5xx as "an empty comment" would be a refusal today and a
#      clearance the moment anything downstream treated one of these codes as benign
#   3  the shape is all there, and at least one ELEMENT is over the ceiling. stderr names
#      every one — which element, its index, its measured size — because a bare exit code
#      leaves an author diffing their own reply against a number they have to go and read
#
# WHAT IT PRINTS IS UNTRUSTED TEXT. The comment comes from a pull request, which anyone
# able to comment can write. Nothing from it is echoed except a bounded EXCERPT of an
# offending element, reduced to printable ASCII (every other byte becomes `.`, which under
# `LC_ALL=C` also removes every control byte and so every terminal escape) and truncated
# to 60 bytes.
#
# AND A TRUNCATED COPY OF THIS FILE IS UNKNOWN STATE TOO — the sibling's lesson, taken
# whole: `--self-test` proves this file RUNS, which is not proving it is COMPLETE. A copy
# cut off below the self-test block still runs and still prints the sentinel. The last line
# of this file is therefore a completeness sentinel, asserted by `--self-test`, which no
# cut short of the end can satisfy.
#
# No `set -e`: a `grep` that finds nothing is an ANSWER here, not a fault, and under `-e`
# the first such test would exit the script with a success-looking code. Every failure path
# below is explicit.
set -uo pipefail

# --- table 1: the verdict vocabulary ------------------------------------------
# One POSIX ERE per line, matched case-insensitively against an entry's own text. Blank
# lines and whole-line `#` comments are ignored; a pattern may not carry a trailing
# comment, because the whole line is the pattern. Every row is compiled up front by
# `validate_tables`, because a table that will not compile is not a table that matches
# less, it is a table that matches NOTHING — and here that turns every reply into a
# refusal for a reason that is not about the reply.
#
# NO BACKSLASH ESCAPES IN EITHER TABLE. Both travel into `awk` through `-v`, which
# processes escape sequences in the value BEFORE the string is ever used as a regex: a row
# written `\*\*` arrives as `**`, which is not a valid ERE, and awk then dies on the first
# comment it reads rather than matching less. Spell a literal with a bracket expression
# (`[*]`, `[.]`) instead. `validate_tables` compiles every row THROUGH THE SAME `-v` PATH
# for exactly this reason — a check that compiled them with `grep -E` passed while awk
# could not read them, which is a guard testing something other than what runs.
#
# WIDER THAN THE THREE WORDS THE RULE USES, ON PURPOSE. `CONVENTIONS.md` writes *valid /
# declined / already deferred*; the measured corpus also says `fixed` (24 times),
# `confirmed`, `correct`, `addressed`, `agreed`, `not taking`, `not changed`, `out of
# scope` and `duplicate`. Refusing those would refuse correct work. `already` is NOT a verdict on its
# own — the corpus has nine uses of it as an ordinary adverb ("already landed", "already
# rare") — so it only counts in the fixed phrases below.

# --- table 2: the carve-outs ---------------------------------------------------

#
# EVERY ROW IS ANCHORED AT THE START OF A LINE and must lead that line's own content
