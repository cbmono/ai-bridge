install.sh is retired. The bundle installer ships in the ai-bridge PLUGIN now.

  1. Install the plugin, once per machine:
       /plugin marketplace add cbmono/ai-bridge
       /plugin install ai-bridge@ai-bridge
     …then restart Claude Code.

  2. Create or refresh a bundle, from any session:
       /ai-bridge:init <dir>

That command creates a bundle, refreshes an existing one, and CONVERTS a bundle
stamped by this script: it removes the machinery symlinks into a template checkout
and leaves your data untouched. You no longer need a clone of cbmono/ai-bridge on
this machine at all.

  · the ~/.claude config layer (was `install.sh --config`):
       bash <clone>/plugin/scripts/init-bundle.sh --config
  · the seed 3-way merge (was `upgrade.sh`):
       /ai-bridge:welcome fix

Why: a plugin-shipped installer cannot stamp absolute symlinks into a plugin cache
whose path changes on every update. docs/migrating.md walks the conversion.
