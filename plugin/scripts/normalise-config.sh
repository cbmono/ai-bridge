# normalise-config.sh — report, or --apply, config findings across a bundle's two files.
#
#   Usage: normalise-config.sh [<bundle>] [--apply] [--quiet]
#
# MISPLACED a per-machine key in the tracked file, or a tracked-only key in the local one ·
# MISSING a seed key the tracked file lacks · ORDER keys not in seed order. Values are
# never changed: only placed, ordered, or added when absent. With --apply the tracked file
# is left STAGED, never committed. Exit 0 clean/applied · 1 findings · 2 usage · 3 write.
# The overridable set has one source, SCHEMA.md → "Per-machine config overrides"; the
# reasoning lives in docs/operations.md § 1.
