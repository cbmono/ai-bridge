#
#   Usage: tick-lock.sh acquire [--as launcher|tick] [--agent <id>] [--claimant <id>]
#                                       [--instance DIR]

#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `/pm-loop` promises at most one PM tick at a time. Until this script,
# that promise rested on TWO things, and neither is a mechanism:
#
#   1. THE LAUNCHING SESSION REMEMBERING IT DISPATCHED. `/pm-loop` step 4 defines "still
#      in flight" as "this session dispatched a tick and has not yet seen its
#      notification" — answered from session history, which a compaction, a `--resume` or
#      a human asking "what's next?" all discard. Measured 2026-08-29 in a real instance:
#      two ticks ran concurrently for ~34 minutes, doing the same refinement work twice.
#      The session that caused it said so plainly — "I dispatched a second tick before the
#      first one's completion notification arrived."
#   2. THE TICK'S OWN LEDGER CHECK (`project-manager.md` step 0.5), which is real and
#      well-written and CANNOT close this window, because it runs INSIDE the tick:
#
#        launcher dispatches A ──► A: step 0 `git pull` ──► A: 0.5 checks ──► A writes "open"
#                            ▲
#              a tick dispatched anywhere in here sees NO open entry
#
#      Seconds to minutes in which the ledger truthfully reports nothing running. That
#      ledger is untouched by this script and stays the TICK's own record; this is a
#      second, earlier gate, at the only moment anybody knows "I am dispatching right now".
#
# THE CHECK AND THE WRITE ARE ONE SYSCALL, WHICH IS THE POINT. `acquire` creates the lock
# under `set -o noclobber` — an `O_EXCL` create. There is no read-then-write to interleave,
# so the window that defeated the ledger check does not exist here even in principle. That
# is also why `status` exists as a SEPARATE subcommand and why the launcher must never call
# it: `status` then `acquire` would rebuild the very TOCTOU race this replaces.
#
# TWO PATHS MAKE A TICK RUN, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM MAY. The launcher takes the lock
# immediately before it dispatches, and that stays — only the launcher knows "I am
# dispatching right now", which is the window above. But a tick can also START WITHOUT
# PASSING THROUGH THE LAUNCHER: `SendMessage` wakes a completed agent directly, so no
# `acquire` runs, nothing is written, and a later `acquire` by a genuine dispatch correctly
# reports the lock free — because it is. Measured 2026-08-30, about an hour after this file
# merged: a resumed tick and a dispatched tick ran concurrently and the human, not the
# machinery, spotted it. The guard behaved exactly as designed and the outcome was still two
# ticks. A mechanism placed on the path you were thinking about is not a mechanism on every
# path, and the second path is the one that bites because nobody audits it. So `--as tick`
# is a second acquire site, run by the tick itself — but it is a GATE, not a second way in.
#
# A TICK RUNS ONLY UNDER A LOCK THE LAUNCHER TOOK, SO `--as tick` NEVER CREATES ONE. No
# lock on disk means nobody dispatched you, because the launcher takes it in the same
# breath as the spawn — so you are a resumed tick, or one somebody started by hand, and
# both are REFUSED (exit 4). Until 2026-08-30 this path took a lock of its own instead:
# the resumed tick then RAN and the next genuine dispatch stood down. Exactly one tick
# ran, which was the property being defended, and it was the wrong one — a tick re-entering
# a loop whose state has moved on, carrying context from work that is already finished. A
# tick is the one thing that is never resumed, without exception; the rule for every other
# agent (same task, same PR, next round) is in CONVENTIONS.md, where its readers are.
#
# THE CRUX: A DISPATCHED TICK MUST NOT REFUSE ITS OWN LOCK. The launcher takes the lock and
# then spawns; the tick it spawned then finds a held lock that is ITS OWN. A tick that
# cannot tell that from a sibling's refuses on entry, and then EVERY dispatched tick
# deadlocks — a total outage of the loop, strictly worse than the concurrency bug being
# fixed. The distinction is one bit of state, and deliberately NOT a guess about elapsed
# time (a resume seconds after a dispatch would sail through) nor a nonce passed down the
# dispatch prompt (prose carried by a model is the class of mechanism that keeps failing
# here). It is this: a lock the launcher took has NOT YET BEEN CLAIMED BY A TICK, and a lock
# a tick is running under HAS.
#
#   .tick-lock        the lock. Taken by the LAUNCHER, and now only ever by it. Its shape,
#                     its clock and its staleness rule are unchanged.
#   .tick-lock.claim  the tick's claim on that lock, created with `O_EXCL` like the lock
#                     itself the first time a tick runs under it. It records WHOSE it is —
#                     see the next section, which is why it is no longer mere existence.
#
#   --as tick, no lock                  -> REFUSED (4). Nothing dispatched you, so you are
#                                          a resume: end the tick, take nothing, run none.
#   --as tick, live lock, unclaimed     -> the dispatch that spawned you. Claim it and
#                                          proceed; the LAUNCHER releases it, not you.
#   --as tick, live lock, PROVABLY your -> you are already running under it. Proceed,
#                     claim               unchanged: `re-entered:`, then the same
#                                          obligation line your first acquire printed.
#   --as tick, live lock, NOT yours     -> report and hold: dispatch nothing, adopt
#                                          nothing, end.
#   --as tick, live lock, claim that    -> exit 2. Both identities are printed and a HUMAN
#                     MIGHT be yours      decides. See the next two sections: this is the
#                                          normal answer under Claude Code today.
#   --as launcher (the default)         -> unchanged in every respect: any live lock
#                                          refuses, claimed or not, and it never claims.
#
# An `--as tick` acquire that proceeds prints `adopted:` on stdout, optionally preceded by
# `re-entered:`, and that is its only success — a tick never takes a lock of its own, so it
# never releases one either. The `--as launcher` path stays byte-silent, exactly as before.
#
# A CLAIM THAT CANNOT SAY WHOSE IT IS TELLS A TICK IT IS AN INTRUDER. Existence was the
# whole signal until 2026-08-30, and hours after that shipped a dispatched tick held and
# dispatched nothing, reporting a different tick — the claim it had found was its own:
#
#     taken   13:28:49Z   the launcher, immediately before spawning
#     claimed 13:29:33Z   the tick it spawned, on entry
#
# The contract was correct only while a tick acquired EXACTLY ONCE. Any re-entry — a second
# `acquire`, a `SendMessage` resume, a retry after a transient error — makes a tick
# indistinguishable from an intruder to itself. So the claim now records a CLAIMANT, and
# the claimed branch splits in two: your own claim is a re-entry and proceeds; anyone
# else's still reports and holds.
#
# THE NARROWER FIX WAS CONSIDERED AND DOES NOT HOLD, which is why the claimant exists at
# all. The tempting argument is: the launcher spawns exactly one tick per lock, so a
# claimed lock met by an `--as tick` caller must BE that tick, and genuine concurrency is
# better caught where two LAUNCHERS collide — which the lock already catches before any
# claim exists. The premise is true and the conclusion is false, because the concurrency
# this file was extended for has only ONE launcher in it: a resumed tick never passes
# through a launcher at all. Launcher takes the lock, dispatched tick A claims it, resumed
# tick R arrives — R meets A's claim with no second launcher anywhere in the sequence, and
# "claimed means it is you" would let both run. That is the 34-minute double-dispatch of
# 2026-08-29, reopened. The claimed branch has to stay; it only has to learn whose.
#
# WHERE THE IDENTITY COMES FROM, AND WHY NOT FROM THE FOUR OBVIOUS PLACES. It must be
# reproducible by the same tick on a later call — including across a resume, where the
# process is gone — and different between two concurrent ticks:
#
#   NOT `--agent`.      Both the launcher and the tick pass `project-manager`; it names a
#                       ROLE, and two ticks of one role are exactly the case to separate.
#   NOT elapsed time.   A resume seconds after a dispatch reads identically to a fresh
#                       intruder — the guess this file already refused once.
#   NOT a nonce in the  Prose carried by a model across an agent boundary is the failure
#   dispatch prompt.    class this whole design keeps being bitten by.
#   NOT the process.    `$$`/`$PPID` are a new value on every call and gone on a resume.
#
# So there are three sources, and they fall into TWO TIERS, which is the whole of the
# mechanism:
#
#   DECLARED   `--claimant <id>`, then `TICK_CLAIMANT`. The caller states "this names THIS
#              TICK" — a promise, the way `--agent` is a promise. Two declared ids that
#              match are the same tick, and that is the only thing this file ever treats
#              as proof.
#   DERIVED    `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, read from the environment when nothing was
#              declared. It is whatever the runtime happens to export, and NOBODY promised
#              it is per-tick. See below: it is not.
#
# THE RUNTIME'S ID NAMES A SESSION, NOT A TICK — MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. On 2026-08-30 a
# parent session and a subagent it dispatched were read side by side:
#
#     parent    CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID=aaf01a1c-fc30-4e96-99e9-a2c43733c10f
#     subagent  CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID=aaf01a1c-fc30-4e96-99e9-a2c43733c10f
#
# Identical, character for character. Every tick one `/pm-loop` session starts carries the
# same value, so as a positive signal it is worthless — and worse than worthless, because
# the sequence it gets wrong is the exact one the claimed branch was kept for: launcher S
# dispatches tick A, A claims, S resumes tick R, and R reads A's claim as its own. That is
# the 34-minute double-dispatch of 2026-08-29, waved through by the guard meant to catch
# it. `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION` does not rescue it (`1` on both sides). A per-agent id
# DOES exist on disk — see "THE PER-TICK IDENTITY IS REACHABLE" below, which corrects the
# path this comment used to guess at — but nothing per-agent is exported to the shell, so
# there is no per-tick identity this script can read.
#
# THEREFORE THE TRUST IS ASYMMETRIC: A DERIVED ID MAY REFUSE, BUT MAY NEVER CLEAR. That one
# rule is what makes this safe, and it is the whole difference from the first attempt:
#
#   both sides DECLARED and equal  -> a re-entry. Proceed (exit 0).
#   the two ids differ             -> not yours. Hold (exit 1), as before claimants.
#   either side has no id          -> not yours. Hold (exit 1), as before claimants.
#   equal, but either side DERIVED -> CANNOT TELL. Exit 2, both ids printed, a human rules.
#
# The last row is the normal case under Claude Code, and exit 2 is deliberately not exit 0
# and not exit 1. Not 0, because "the ids match" does not mean "you", and proceeding on it
# is the double-dispatch. Not 1, because "a DIFFERENT tick is already running" is a claim
# this file cannot support and stating it anyway is precisely what sent a tick home on
# 2026-08-30. Exit 2 is this script's existing answer for a lock it will not judge — the
# same answer a stale lock gets, for the same reason: surface it and let a human decide.
# It is also RARE by construction, because a claim only exists when a tick is already
# running, which on the ordinary dispatch path never happens twice.
#
# WHICH SOURCE ANSWERED IS RECORDED IN THE CLAIM (`claimant-source: flag|env|session`), so
# a change of identity source is visible in the file rather than inferred from behaviour,
# and both ids are printed on every refusal. The one question an operator has here — "is
# that a real sibling, or is my own id not stable?" — must be answerable by reading the
# output, because it is the question that got this mechanism rewritten once already.
#
# AND IT DEGRADES TOWARDS THE OLD BEHAVIOUR, NEVER PAST IT — IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. Identity
# ABSENT (the variable unset, or holding something that is not a plain id) means no
# `claimant:` is written and no claim matches: exactly what this script did before, and the
# refusal says which side was missing instead of leaving a human to wonder. Identity
# COLLAPSED — two ticks resolving to ONE id — is the direction that actually hurts, because
# a false match would PROCEED, and it is closed by the asymmetry above rather than by hoping
# it does not happen. There is no input to this file, environment or flag, that turns a
# claimed lock into a dispatch unless a caller declared a per-tick identity and it matched.
#
# THE CLAIM IS PART OF THE LOCK, NOT A SECOND LOCK. It carries a timestamp for a human to
# read, and that timestamp is NEVER a second staleness clock: "is this stale?" is computed
# from `.tick-lock` alone, exactly as before, so claiming cannot refresh a lock's deadline.
# The claimant does not change that and is deliberately checked LAST — a lock that is stale,
# future-dated or unreadable gets that answer even for the tick whose claim it is, because
# recognising yourself is not a licence to run past a deadline a human has to rule on.
# `release` removes both, and nothing else removes either.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLOSE — STATED RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE DISCOVERED, AND MEASURED RATHER
# THAN CALLED SMALL. Two ticks can still swap places inside the launcher's own DISPATCH
# WINDOW: the interval between the launcher taking the lock and the tick it spawned claiming
# it. A resumed tick reaching its `acquire` in that window meets a live UNCLAIMED lock —
# which is exactly what a fresh dispatch looks like — so it adopts and runs, and the genuine
# tick then holds. Exactly one tick runs, which is the property that matters, but `/pm-loop`
# step 2 releases that lock when its own (held) tick reports, freeing a lock the resumed
# tick is still running under.
#
# THE WINDOW IS NOT MICROSECONDS, AND AN EARLIER DRAFT OF THIS PARAGRAPH IMPLIED IT WAS.
# Measured twice in a live instance on 2026-08-30, hours apart, on two unrelated dispatches:
#
#   taken       claimed     window   the tick's transcript was created at
#   16:00:11Z   16:00:58Z   47s      16:00:38Z  (spawn 27s in, claim 20s after that)
#   18:18:30Z   18:19:11Z   41s      18:18:56Z  (spawn 26s in, claim 15s after that)
#
# FORTY-SEVEN and FORTY-ONE seconds, covering the spawn and everything the tick does before
# it reaches step 0.5. The previous wording said "the seconds between" and called this "the
# rarer half of an already rare race"; neither adjective had a measurement behind it, and
# both are gone. Two numbers rather than one because the first could have been an outlier
# and is not: agent-spawn latency alone is 26-27s in both, so no reordering of the existing
# calls gets this under half a minute. The microsecond race in this file is a different one
# — `release`'s two `rm`s, below.
#
# IT IS NOT CLOSED HERE, AND THE REASON IS THAT EVERY CANDIDATE REMEDY IS ALREADY-DECIDED
# GROUND. Named, so the next reader does not spend the same afternoon on them:
#
#   A ONE-TIME CAPABILITY handed to the spawned tick is a NONCE CARRIED BY THE DISPATCH
#   PROMPT under another name — prose carried across an agent boundary by a model, refused
#   twice above and the failure class this whole file keeps being bitten by.
#
#   VERIFYING THE CLAIMANT BEFORE RELEASING means asking `release` who is calling, which an
#   override must never do. `release --as tick` is exit 3 precisely so `release` cannot be
#   scoped, and that is pinned by tests rather than left to discipline.
#
#   MAKING THE TICK ACQUIRE EARLIER shortens the window and cannot close it — the residue is
#   agent-spawn latency — and it would put the guarantee back into a model following prose,
#   which is the mechanism class this file exists to replace.
#
# What would close it is a PER-TICK identity delivered through a channel that is neither the
# dispatch prompt nor `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` (which names the SESSION — measured below).
# That channel was looked for on 2026-08-30, and the next two sections are what was found:
# it EXISTS, it is not usable from here, and both halves are written down so the search is
# not repeated.
#
# THE PER-TICK IDENTITY IS REACHABLE — MEASURED FROM INSIDE A DISPATCHED AGENT, NOT INFERRED.
# The question is not open any more, and the answer is not the one this file used to assume.
# EVERY PATH BELOW IS RECORDED, NOT READ: this script opens none of them and depends on none
# of them, which is reason 3 further down and not an oversight. They are stamped with the CLI
# version they were measured on so a reader can tell a stale note from a current one:
#
#   NOTHING PER-AGENT IS EXPORTED. Every variable in a dispatched agent's environment was
#   read. The ids among them are all SESSION- or PROCESS-POOL-scoped, none per-agent:
#     CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID     the session (byte-identical to the parent's — a third
#                                independent confirmation of the measurement above)
#     CLAUDE_JOB_DIR             ~/.claude/jobs/<session-id-short> — the session again
#     CLAUDE_PID, and the socket path derived from it — a REUSED CLI process, not an
#                                agent: 19 live sockets against a handful of live agents
#     CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION  `1` — a boolean, so it separates subagents from parents
#                                and never one subagent from another
#
#   THE ID EXISTS ON DISK, AND THIS FILE HAD ITS PATH WRONG. It is not `<session-id>/
#   subagents/<agent-id>` and not `<session-dir>/tasks/<agent-id>.output`; both guesses
#   predate anyone looking. Measured shape, CLI 2.1.251:
#     <session-dir>/subagents/agent-<agent-id>.jsonl        the transcript
#     <session-dir>/subagents/agent-<agent-id>.meta.json    {agentType, description,
#                                                            toolUseId, parentAgentId,
#                                                            spawnDepth, model}
#     $CLAUDE_JOB_DIR/state.json  ->  fan[] of {id, kind, label, startedAt}
#   The session dir needs no path-slug arithmetic. A glob on the one exported variable
#   reaches it: `~/.claude/projects/*/"$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID"/subagents`.
#
#   AN AGENT CAN FIND ITS OWN RECORD IN A SINGLE INVOCATION. The `tool_use` record carrying
#   a command is committed to the agent's own transcript BEFORE that command runs, so a
#   literal appearing only in this invocation's argv is already on disk when the process
#   starts. Measured: such a literal matched exactly 1 of 15 transcripts, and it was the
#   right one. No second tool call, no round-trip, nothing carried in a prompt.
#
#   AND THE ID SURVIVES A RESUME, which is the property a guard here would need. A resumed
#   agent APPENDS to its existing transcript — 4 of the 15 here do, each with a fresh user
#   turn arriving 394-1455s after the previous record, so they are resumes and not inline
#   injections — and one of the four is a PM TICK. The file name, and the first record's
#   timestamp, therefore stay the ORIGINAL dispatch. That is exactly the ordering fact the
#   window needs: a resumed tick's transcript predates the lock it is about to meet, and a
#   dispatched tick's does not.
#
# AND IT IS STILL NOT USED HERE. THREE REASONS, EACH SUFFICIENT ON ITS OWN.
#
#   1. SELF-IDENTIFICATION NEEDS A PER-INVOCATION LITERAL, AND THIS SCRIPT'S ARGV HAS NONE.
#      Every tick runs the same `acquire --as tick` command line, so the match above has
#      nothing unique to match on. Supplying one means a model generating and typing a fresh
#      value per tick — which is the nonce this design has refused twice, moved one boundary
#      inward rather than removed. The measurement is real; the hook for it is not there.
#   2. WITHOUT ONE, THE FALLBACK IS AMBIGUOUS EXACTLY WHERE IT MATTERS. The remaining
#      discriminator is "the newest-mtime `project-manager` transcript", and in the window
#      this guard exists for there are two: the genuine tick, mid-spawn and being written,
#      and the resumed tick, whose own `tool_use` record was appended microseconds ago.
#      A guard that ties in its own motivating case is the stage-for-an-actor mistake again.
#   3. IT WOULD COUPLE A GENERIC TEMPLATE TO AN UNDOCUMENTED PRIVATE LAYOUT. This file reads
#      no org, repo or path literal by design. The layout above is one CLI version's
#      internals, and the evidence that it is not knowable from the outside is this file
#      itself: two documents guessed that path and BOTH were wrong.
#
# THE ORDERING-INVARIANT VARIANT WAS ALSO TRIED, AND IT IS THE ALREADY-REJECTED REMEDY IN A
# NEW COAT. "Adopt only if SOME project-manager agent was spawned after this lock was taken"
# needs no identity at all and is genuinely sound — but the table above prices it: the
# transcript appears 26-27s in and the claim lands 15-20s later, so it shrinks 41s to about
# 15s and CANNOT CLOSE IT. Shortens-but-cannot-close is precisely why "make the tick acquire
# earlier" is refused above, and a second mechanism earning the same verdict is not an
# improvement over a gap that is documented and shrinking. It is recorded so that the next
# reader prices it before building it.
#
# WHERE THIS LEAVES THE ASYMMETRIC RULE, STATED BEFORE ANY OF IT COULD BE USED. The
# transcript channel is DERIVED — read from the runtime, promised by nobody — so under the
# rule stated above it could only ever REFUSE, never clear. That direction happens to be the one
# the window needs, which is why it was worth measuring at all; the three reasons above are
# what stop it, not the asymmetry.
#
# AND THIS FILE STRICTLY SHRINKS THAT RACE RATHER THAN CREATING IT, which is why the gap
# does not block the refusal above. Before exit 4, a resumed tick meeting NO lock took one
# and ran — every time, with no window to hit. After it, the resume path gets through only
# by landing inside the dispatch window. The gap is open in both versions and smaller here.
#
# WHAT IS CHECKED HERE AND WHAT IS ONLY A CONVENTION, SAID PLAINLY SO NEITHER IS MISTAKEN
# FOR THE OTHER. Refusing a resumed tick HAS a reader and it is this file: no lock, no
# launcher, exit 4, driven by tests/tick-lock.test.sh. Two neighbouring rules have no
# reader anywhere, and must not be read as though this one covered them:
#
#   1. A resume that arrives INSIDE the launcher's dispatch window meets a live UNCLAIMED
#      lock and is, at that instant, indistinguishable from the tick the launcher took it
#      for — so it adopts and runs. That is the 47s/41s window measured above, and it is
#      the one way a resumed tick still gets through. Open, named, and not closed here.
#   2. Whether a resume of any OTHER agent is "the same task" cannot be seen from here or
#      from anywhere else: nothing can read a `SendMessage`'s intent. That half is a
#      convention held by whoever dispatches, written in CONVENTIONS.md and in the
#      dispatchers' own instructions because that is where its only readers are. It is
#      deliberately not implied to be enforced by anything.
#
# `release` REMOVES TWO FILES AND CANNOT REMOVE THEM AS ONE. Between `rm $CLAIM` and
# `rm $LOCK` the pair reads live-and-unclaimed, so a tick acquiring in that window adopts a
# lock that is about to be deleted underneath it. It is microseconds wide, it needs a human
# running the override at that instant, and the outcome is one tick running with no lock —
# recoverable, and strictly smaller than what a caller-aware `release` would cost.
#
# A SESSION THAT CHANGES ITS ID MID-TICK STILL DEADLOCKS, and that is the safe half. One
# conversation was observed running under two `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`s in a day, because
# sessions fork and compact. A long tick that does so meets its own claim as a stranger and
# gets exit 1 — the pre-claimant behaviour, and the direction that costs a re-run rather
# than a duplicate dispatch. It is detectable rather than mysterious: the refusal prints
# both ids and the source that produced each, so "my own id moved" reads differently from
# "somebody else is running".
#
# LIVENESS IS DATA, NOT A JUDGEMENT. The lock carries an ISO-8601 UTC timestamp and the id
# of the agent that was dispatched, so "is this stale?" is computed from the file alone —
# never from session memory, `git log` or the tick ledger, none of which can answer it. A
# lock past `TICK_LOCK_STALE_MINUTES` (default 120) is NOT silently deleted and NOT
# silently treated as live: both are refused on purpose, because silent deletion re-opens
# the double-dispatch and silent adoption is the pressure that makes overriding a stalled
# loop tempting. It is surfaced — timestamp, agent, age, path — and a human decides.
#
# IT IS A PER-CLONE LOCK AND IT MUST NOT PRETEND OTHERWISE. The file is gitignored and
# lives in one working tree. Two humans sharing one bundle from two clones each dispatch
# independently, which is the SUPPORTED design (`/pm-loop` → "Why serial"; SCHEMA.md →
# "Ownership on a shared instance"), and a committed or shared lock would break it. What
# stops those two loops dispatching the same TASK is `task-owner.sh`, not this.
#
# IT BOUNDS TICKS, NOT ROLE AGENTS. `maxAgentsInFlight` (via `resolve-max-agents.sh`)
# is the other concurrency limit and is untouched: it caps the role agents a tick dispatches.
# A held lock must never block those — nothing in the role-agent path reads this file.
#
# ABSENCE IS NEVER AN ERROR — A FAILED CREATE IS. No lock ⇒ `acquire` takes it and says
# nothing (exit 0), which is the launcher behaving exactly as it did before this file
# existed. `release` on a missing lock is a silent success too. But clearance to dispatch
# is the lock being CREATED, never merely being missing: an unwritable instance root is
# exit 3 and a refusal, because dispatching unguarded is the failure this replaces. The
# only silence this script breaks is a refusal.
#
# `release` IS UNCONDITIONAL, AND THAT PUTS AN OBLIGATION ON THE CALLER. It holds no
# session identity and cannot tell your lock from a sibling's — it is the human's
# override, and an override that asked who you were would not be one. So a caller must
# release only a lock IT took: a `/pm-loop` session that skipped because another loop held
# the lock and then released it on the way out would delete a LIVE holder's lock and
# re-open the double-dispatch. `/pm-loop` step 5 states that condition. The second acquire
# site does not relax this and has the simplest obligation there is: A TICK RELEASES
# NOTHING, EVER. The only lock it can be running under is one it ADOPTED, and that one is
# the launcher's to release when the tick reports; a tick that was refused (1, 2 or 4) has
# no lock to release either. A re-entry changes none of that: it re-prints the obligation
# its FIRST acquire printed, read back from `origin:` in the claim, so a tick that
# re-enters cannot turn an adopted lock into one it thinks it should release. `--as` and
# `--claimant` are `acquire` flags only; `release` takes neither, on purpose.
#
# IT READS NO CONFIG. `TICK_LOCK_STALE_MINUTES` and `TICK_CLAIMANT` are environment
# overrides in the shape `prune-worktrees.sh` already uses for `PRUNE_ACTIVE_MINUTES`;
# there is deliberately no `instance.config.json` key for either, so this adds nothing to
# the overridable-key surface. `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` is read too and is not config
# either — it is the runtime's answer to "which session is calling", which is a strictly
# weaker question than "which tick is calling" and is treated as such above.
#
# Exit codes — 0 is the only clearance to dispatch:
#
#   0  acquire: the lock is now yours, dispatch.   release/status: nothing is held.
#   1  HELD — a live lock, younger than the staleness threshold. Do not dispatch. For
#      `--as tick` this means the claim on it is NOT YOURS as far as anything on disk can
#      show: report and hold. Never a claim proved to be yours — that is a 0 (`re-entered:`).
#   2  needs a human: the lock is STALE, dated in the future, unreadable, or CLAIMED BY AN
#      IDENTITY THAT MIGHT BE YOURS AND CANNOT BE PROVED TO BE. Do not dispatch, and do not
#      delete it on the lock's behalf.
#   3  cannot answer: usage, a bad `--agent`/`--claimant`/threshold, or an unwritable root.
#      Never a silent pass — a lock nothing can write is a guarantee nothing is keeping.
#   4  REFUSED — `--as tick` with no lock: nobody dispatched you, so you are a resumed or
#      hand-started tick. End the tick. `--as launcher` never sees this: taking a lock
#      where there is none is exactly what a launcher is for.
