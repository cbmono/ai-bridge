# Enforcement happens in the `agent-control.sh` PreToolUse hook, which reads the
# files this script writes. Read that file's header for the design; this one is the
# human interface, and everything below is about being usable under pressure,
# because a kill switch nobody can find is not a kill switch.
#
# THE TWO HALVES ARE INSTALLED SEPARATELY, and an operator needs to know it here:
# this script is instance machinery, stamped by the installer, while the hook now
# ships with the plugin. Arming an instance whose plugin is not installed writes
# directives nothing reads — `status` still lists them, and nothing fires. The
# install steps are in the operations guide, deliberately not repeated here.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------- WHERE STATE LIVES
# `<instance>/.claude/control/`, created on demand:
#   directives   the control file — one pending directive per line, TAB-separated
#   agents       roster of agent ids the hook has observed, newest last
#   control.log  append-only record of every action the hook actually took
#   .gitignore   a single `*`, so the whole directory is invisible to git
#
# THE `.gitignore` IS NOT COSMETIC. This is machine-local runtime state. Committed,
# it would travel to another clone of a shared bundle and gate that human's agents
# from a file they never wrote. A `*` inside the directory ignores every file in it
# INCLUDING itself, so git sees the directory as empty and never tracks any of it —
# and an empty directory is not a thing git records. That keeps the whole feature
# out of `install.sh` and out of `seed/.gitignore`: it works identically on an
# instance stamped today and one stamped a year ago, with no installer run.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------- ARM / DISARM
# `.claude/control/` ABSENT means the hook is a strict no-op — no read, no write,
# no output. That is the `AUTONOMY.md` idiom: a deployment that never arms this has
# the capability off, with no edits anywhere. `disarm` removes the directory and
# the feature is gone until someone arms it again.
#
# Armed, the hook maintains the roster so `agents` can tell you what to halt. That
# is why arming is a separate act and worth doing BEFORE you need it: an agent
# dispatched while disarmed is not in the roster, and its id is not recorded
# anywhere else in the instance. On an instance running with `AUTONOMY.md` present,
# arm it once and leave it armed — armed-and-empty gates nothing.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------ ONE LINE, ONE PLACE
# `oneline()` below is the SINGLE choke point where operator text becomes a record
# field, and it is the security boundary rather than tidiness: TAB is the field
# separator, and a newline or a carriage return in a reason would either split the
# record or forge the closing marker of the fence the hook injects it inside. Both
# failures are `push-state.sh`'s, measured there. Every reason and note goes
# through this function exactly once; the hook adds no second sanitising pass,
# because the record format itself then makes a raw newline unrepresentable.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------- THE CAP REFUSES, LOUDLY
# `CONTROL_MAX` (default **20**) pending directives. Past that this script REFUSES
# to add another and prints what is pending, rather than FIFO-dropping the oldest
# the way the mechanism this is modelled on does. Silently dropping a halt is the
# one failure the whole feature exists to prevent, so the queue overflowing is a
# human decision about which directive to release.
#
# --------------------------------------------------- RECORDING A HALT IN THE BUNDLE
# The hook writes every action it takes to `control.log` — that is the durable
# record, and `status` surfaces it. This script additionally PRINTS the exact
# `log.md` bullet and its `commit-as.sh` command, and never runs either: the same
# report-the-command shape as `RETIRED`, `prune-worktrees.sh` and `install.sh`'s
# `git rm --cached`. Two reasons. `log.md` is tracked and several agents share one
# working tree, so a spontaneous diff there gets absorbed under the wrong author by
# whichever sibling stages `log.md` by name next. And whether a halt belongs in the
# bundle's permanent history is a judgement — a fat-fingered dispatch and an agent
# pushing to the wrong repo are not the same event.
#
# Verified by tests/agent-control.test.sh.
