# is escalated to the human instead of re-dispatched. PM-owned fields on the task doc:
# stall_count (consecutive rounds on one blocker) and last_blocker. Progress resets it:
# a changed blocker, a human edit (a capped task back in draft/ready), or --progress from
# the tick (PR activity it observed). Usage: record <task> --blocker <text> [--progress] |
# escalate <task> | status <task>. Exit: 0 under the cap (count on stdout), 1 at/over the
# cap (do not dispatch; run escalate), 2 cannot answer, 3 write failed (temp-file writes,
# nothing partial). Reasoning: ai-bridge-next/task-011 and its Finding.
